brew,c7c4921744a91c4cc139e278b380f7c53a81e979,"The manual merge seems to have introduced an error in the code. A variable is accessed without it being initialized at the function scope. Right added this variable at the method signature and updated its body, however left didn't. The developer accepted the change of the method body from RIGHT (which used the variable) but the line that defined the method name and signature from LEFT (that did not add the variable in the method signature). CSDiff would have prevented this error and solved the merge scenario correctly.",manual-modification,"diff3-afp, not-afn"

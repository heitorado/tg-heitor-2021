# 0aa308a705d6ce75d8d521c728be96f24228a617

Added AFP for diff3 (files): 2
Category: manual-modification
Comment: Q1: src/vs/workbench/contrib/notebook/browser/notebook.contribution.ts - Dev preferred to use the changes made in LEFT rather than the changes in RIGHT, but the changes in LEFT did not alter BASE. Manual modification, CSDiff would have merged correctly otherwise.

Q2: src/vs/workbench/contrib/notebook/browser/notebookEditorWidget.ts - There was a newline present in LEFT/BASE but not in RIGHT, so it was likely added by the developer. Manual modification, CSDiff would have merged correctly otherwise.

Q3: Results are equal to each other and to the final merge in the repository
Repository: vscode
Verdict: diff3-afp, not-afn

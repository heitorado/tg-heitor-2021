# 75622a6c6a23b61602a4283e6172ec5b11016f97

Added AFP for diff3 (files): 1
Category: manual-modification
Comment: Q1: src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/browser/disassemblyView.ts - A comment had its text updated and a line of code that CSDiff had merged correctly was encapsulated in a if clause that did not exist anywhere previously on left/right/base. Manual modification, CSDiff would have merged correctly otherwise
Repository: vscode
Verdict: diff3-afp, not-afn

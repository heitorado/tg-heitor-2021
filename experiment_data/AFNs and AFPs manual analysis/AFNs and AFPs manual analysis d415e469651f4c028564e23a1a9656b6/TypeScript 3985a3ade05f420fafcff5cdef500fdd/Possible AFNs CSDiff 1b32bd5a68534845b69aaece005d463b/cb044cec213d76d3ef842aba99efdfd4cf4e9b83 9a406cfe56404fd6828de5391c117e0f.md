Added AFP for diff3 (files): 1
Category: manual-modification
Comment: Q1: src/vs/editor/browser/controller/textAreaInput.ts - Developer in LEFT erased part of line X that was present previously in BASE> Developer in RIGHT adds content content in the same line X. The expected result for the merge should be the line with what was removed by LEFT and added by RIGHT, but the developer preferred to ignore the changes made by LEFT and keep only the changes made by RIGHT.
Repository: vscode
Verdict: diff3-afp, not-afn

Added AFP for diff3 (files): 1
Category: manual-modification
Comment: Q1: extensions/git/src/commands.ts - CSDiff managed to solve the conflicts pointed by diff3 but the result still does not match the final merge. Dev inserted another block of code updating variables and inserting new logic. - Manual modification, CSDiff would have merged correctly otherwise.
Repository: vscode
Verdict: diff3-afp, not-afn

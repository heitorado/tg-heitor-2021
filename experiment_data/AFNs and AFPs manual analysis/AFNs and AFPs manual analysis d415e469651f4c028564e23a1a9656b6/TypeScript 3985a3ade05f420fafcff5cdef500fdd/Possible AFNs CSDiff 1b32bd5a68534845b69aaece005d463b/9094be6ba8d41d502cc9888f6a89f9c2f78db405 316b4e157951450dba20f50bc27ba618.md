Comment: Q1: Results are equal to each other and to the final merge in the repository

Q2: Results are equal to each other and to the final merge in the repository 

Q3: src/vs/workbench/contrib/notebook/browser/notebookEditor.ts - diff3 duplicated 3 import lines that got merged into the final code. CSDiff would have prevented those lines from being merged. Manual modification, CSDiff would have merged correctly otherwise.
Repository: vscode
Verdict: diff3-afp, not-afn

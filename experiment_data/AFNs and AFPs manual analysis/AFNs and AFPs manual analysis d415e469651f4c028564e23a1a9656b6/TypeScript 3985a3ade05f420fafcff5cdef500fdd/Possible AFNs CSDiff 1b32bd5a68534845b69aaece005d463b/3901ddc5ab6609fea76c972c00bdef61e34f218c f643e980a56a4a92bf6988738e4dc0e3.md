# 3901ddc5ab6609fea76c972c00bdef61e34f218c

Added AFP for diff3 (files): 1
Category: manual-modification
Comment: Q1: lib/stories.ts - Complex case. Manual changes were made: Neither diff3 nor CSDiff would have got it right in this case, because the necessary adjustments impact on the overall code semantic. In the conflicts that CSDiff solved correctly, the code semantics was harmed. 

Q2: layout.ts - Modifications to the final merge file removed some imports. Manual modification, CSDiff would have merged correctly otherwise
Repository: storybook
Verdict: diff3-afp

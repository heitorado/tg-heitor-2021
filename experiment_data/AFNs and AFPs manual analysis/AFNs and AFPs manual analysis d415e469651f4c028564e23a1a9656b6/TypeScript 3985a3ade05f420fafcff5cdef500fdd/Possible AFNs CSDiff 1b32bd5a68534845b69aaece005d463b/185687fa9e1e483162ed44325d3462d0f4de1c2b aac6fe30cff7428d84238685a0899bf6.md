# 185687fa9e1e483162ed44325d3462d0f4de1c2b

Added AFP for diff3 (files): 1
Category: manual-modification
Comment: Q(quadruple)1: both tools diverged from the original merde due to a whitespace removed manually from the final merge result.

Q2: In another file quadruple we can observe 2 conflicts present for diff3 that are not present for csdiff, however both results diverge due to a manual change at the final merge result. CSDiff would have got it right if it wasn't this change.

Q3: Similar to Q1
Repository: storybook
Verdict: diff3-afp, not-afn
